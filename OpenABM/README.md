## About CoMSES Net / OpenABM
  CoMSES Net, the Network for Computational Modeling in Social and Ecological Sciences, is an open community of researchers, educators, and professionals with a common goal - improving the way we develop, share, use, and re-use agent based and computational models for the study of social and ecological systems. We develop and maintain the CoMSES Model Library, a digital repository that supports discovery and good practices for software citation, digital preservation, reproducibility, and reuse. We encourage you to join CoMSES Net and add your models to the archive.
  We are governed by an international executive board, ex-officio members (PIs on projects that fund CoMSES Net) and adhere to these community drafted by-laws.
