 # Unit 1

### Key Terms
#### 1.6
- Complexity
- Emergence
- Feedbacks
- Path Dependency: current possibilities limited by past choices (variant vs invariant regions)
- Sensitivity to Intitial Conditions. Lorenz curve. Butterfly Effect.
  - Chaos' when the present determins the future, but the appoximate present does not approximately determine the future - Lorenz
  - Weak version 'where you start matters significantly'
- Non-linearity and Dynamics
- Robustness: system maintains its characteristic behavior even after perturbation (resillience?) 
- Diversity and Heterogenity
  - Most traditional modeling approaches fail to accurately capture heterogeneity of individuals
