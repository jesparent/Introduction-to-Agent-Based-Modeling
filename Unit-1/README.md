 # Unit 1

### Notes & Terms
#### 1.6 (ABM related terms)
- Complexity
- Emergence
- Feedbacks
- Path Dependency: current possibilities limited by past choices (variant vs invariant regions)
- Sensitivity to Intitial Conditions. Lorenz curve. Butterfly Effect.
  - Chaos' when the present determins the future, but the appoximate present does not approximately determine the future - Lorenz
  - Weak version 'where you start matters significantly'
- Non-linearity and Dynamics
- Robustness: system maintains its characteristic behavior even after perturbation (resillience?) 
- Diversity and Heterogenity
  - Most traditional modeling approaches fail to accurately capture heterogeneity of individuals
  - Standing Ovation problem (different trehsholds for when / who stands). Honey Bee wings. 
- Interconnectedness and Interactions
  - Retweet networks

#### 1.7 Why Use ABM
- Representation
  - Representation as key to understanding phenomeon ( E G R T ). Math vs Models.
- Benefits of Appropriate Representation
  - New representations, new ways of solving problems (Me: NEW TECHNIQUES, NEW DISCOVERIES, NEW IDEAS)
  - ABM communicate results 
  - (basically, visualizations)
- Representations of Complex Systems
- A Thid Way of Doing Science
  1. Induction: inferring from particular data to a general theory
  2. Deduction: resoning from first principles to a general theory
  3. Generative: use first principles to generate a particualre set of data that can create a general theory (Axelrod. 1997)
- Integrative Understanding
  - If one knows first principled rules, can you determine the aggregate pattern
  - This is often difficult, ABM as a method for understanding this
- Differential Understanding
  - What if we know the aggregate pattern  and want to figure out individual level-rules?
  - Flocking Model exercise
  - Propose rules and see if they generate phenomenon we observe
