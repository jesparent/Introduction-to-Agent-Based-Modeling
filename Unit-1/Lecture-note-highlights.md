# Unit 1: What is Agent-Based Modeling and Why Should You Use It?
## Notes & Terms
### 1.6 (ABM related terms)
- Complexity
- Emergence
- Feedbacks
- Path Dependency: current possibilities limited by past choices (variant vs invariant regions)
- Sensitivity to Intitial Conditions. Lorenz curve. Butterfly Effect.
  - Chaos' when the present determins the future, but the appoximate present does not approximately determine the future - Lorenz
  - Weak version 'where you start matters significantly'
- Non-linearity and Dynamics
- Robustness: system maintains its characteristic behavior even after perturbation (resillience?) 
- Diversity and Heterogenity
  - Most traditional modeling approaches fail to accurately capture heterogeneity of individuals
  - Standing Ovation problem (different trehsholds for when / who stands). Honey Bee wings. 
- Interconnectedness and Interactions
  - Retweet networks

### 1.7 Why Use ABM
- Representation
  - Representation as key to understanding phenomeon ( E G R T ). Math vs Models.
- Benefits of Appropriate Representation
  - New representations, new ways of solving problems (Me: NEW TECHNIQUES, NEW DISCOVERIES, NEW IDEAS)
  - ABM communicate results 
  - (basically, visualizations)
- Representations of Complex Systems
- A Thid Way of Doing Science
  1. Induction: inferring from particular data to a general theory
  2. Deduction: resoning from first principles to a general theory
  3. Generative: use first principles to generate a particualre set of data that can create a general theory (Axelrod. 1997)
- Integrative Understanding
  - If one knows first principled rules, can you determine the aggregate pattern
  - This is often difficult, ABM as a method for understanding this
- Differential Understanding
  - What if we know the aggregate pattern  and want to figure out individual level-rules?
  - Flocking Model exercise
  - Propose rules and see if they generate phenomenon we observe
  
### 1.8 When you should use ABM
  The more of these features, the more you ABM applicable
1. Medium Numbers
   - If too fiew agents, system may be too simple: try game theory or ethnography
   - Too many agents and averages may describe fields (mean-field, stat descriptions)
   - The number of agents that can affect outcome of system should be a median number (Casti, 1996)
2. Heterogeneity
   - as hetero as they need to be
3. Complex but Local Interactions
   - history & property dependent 
   - assumptions are local - no global knowledge
4. Rich Environments
   - Environments can have own agent-like rules
   - Provesss (ABM) vs Pattern (environment)
5. Time
   - Ticks as discrete units of time
   - exceptions to necessity: complex equlibrium problems
6. Adaptation
   - ^ when agent's actions are contingent on their past history (DEVELOPMENT)
   - Agent may take different actions depending on its own past experience
   - Usually sufficient
   - Few modeling approaches besides ABM feature adaptive individuals 

### 1.9 Comparing ABM To other methods (Equation-Based et al)
- vs Equation-Based Modeling
   - EBMs may assume homogeneity
   - EBMs are often continous and not discrete (nano-wolf problem, Wilson 1998)
   - Aggregate knowledge
   - Ontology of EBMs at global level
   - EBM does not provide local detail
   - EBMs are top-down, ABM bottom-up
   - EBM are generalizable, but restricted
   - ABM can be built from analytical models, and can complement EBMs
- vs Statistical Modeling
   - Hard to link to first principles and behavioral theory
   - Need to ahve the right kind of data
   - ABM can compliment by building from first principles to statstic results 
- vs Lab Experiments
   - can generate theory
   - rarely scaled up
   - ABM from Lab experiments
     - macro-implications of lab experiments
     - new hypotheses, determine sensitivity of results, generative principles
 - vs Aggregate CPU Modeling
   - System Dynamics Modeling embraces a system-level approach to thinking about the world
   - Lacks individual-level representation
   - Hybrid models are possible 
- Limitations
   - High computational cost
   - Many free parameters
   - May require individual-level behavioral knowledge 
 - Why resistance against ABM?
   - Lack of education about complex systems
   - "parable of the drunk, keys, and streetlight"
   - Centralized and Deterministic Mindset (Resnick and Wilensky, 1993)
     - People expect there to be a central leader. Everything happens to a "cause", negate possibility of chance.
