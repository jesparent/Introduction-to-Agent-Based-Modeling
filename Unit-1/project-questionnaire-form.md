PROJECT QUESTIONNAIRE
Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling Course

This information sheet and questionnaire is intended to prepare you for generating your project.  By taking some time to go through the materials below, it will help us in making the course as productive as possible. In addition to filling out the questionnaire below, we ask that you download the NetLogo modeling environment from the CCLÕs website at: http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/. Click on the ÒDownloadÓ link and from there follow the directions to install NetLogo on your machine. Version 5.3.1 is what we will be using during the course. 

Tutorials

In order to familiarize yourself with the tools, there are some basic NetLogo tutorials for you to use. We recommend this practice in advance in order to get the most out of the course experience. The tutorials take a couple of hours but will give you the skills you need to make the most out of the course. To access these tutorials: 

1. Start up NetLogo, and click on ÒHelpÓ in the menu bar.
2. Then choose ÒUser ManualÓ.  
3. Once the User Manual loads up in your browser, you will see three tutorials listed on the left-hand side under ÒLearning NetLogo.Ó

   If you have any questions with any of this or need help, please email abm@complexityexplorer.org

Model Questionnaire

Modeling, particularly agent-based modeling, is particularly useful in helping you frame and solve issues that have a large number of interacting entities and complex processes, and thus the result is highly unpredictable.  In this section we will provide you with some criteria to help in selecting a particular phenomenon to examine.  We will be sharing more about the value of ABM at the opening of the session but want you to be able to choose a complex but approachable phenomenon that will particularly benefit from ABM.  Note that we are purposely using the language of complexity science and agent-based modeling in this worksheet (e.g., agents) so you can become more and more familiar with what makes a complexity science approach different from other, perhaps more common or traditional approaches.

These questions are intended to focus your thoughts on a phenomenon for which you would eventually like to build an ABM model. It is important to choose a phenomenon of limited scope so that you can make progress with your model.  Even if the phenomenon you would eventually like to address is large in scope, try to choose a sub-part of it as a starting point.


(1) What part of your phenomenon would you like to build a model of?





(2) What are the principal types of agents involved in this phenomenon?





(3)   What properties do these agents have (describe by agent type)?





(4)   What actions (or behaviors) can these agents take (describe by agent type)?





(5)   If the agents have goals, what are their goals (describe by agent type)?





(6)   In what kind of environment do these agents operate?





(7)   How do these agents interact with this environment?





(8)   If you had to ÒdiscretizeÓ the phenomenon into time steps, what events and in what order would occur during any one time step?





(9)   What do you hope to observe from this model?


# Responses

- (1) What part of your phenomenon would you like to build a model of?
  - Teamwork or amounts of cooperation between agents of different collboration viewsw

- (2) What are the principal types of agents involved in this phenomenon?
  - Biological life forms. Potentially humans, social animals.

- (3) What properties do these agents have (describe by agent type)?
  - Variations of cooperation. This could be motivation, resoures, cultures, etc. 
  - Most basic division: 
    - Type 1 agents are uncooperative and do not interact with resources together
    - Type 2 agents are coooperative and interact with resources together 

- (4) What actions (or behaviors) can these agents take (describe by agent type)?
  - They can identify resources in the enviornment 
  - Type 1 Agents will not recognize or make choices based off of presence of other agents
  - Type 2 agents will seek to oprate in concert with other agents

- (5) If the agents have goals, what are their goals (describe by agent type)?
  - Type 1: collect resources
  - Type 2: collect resources, work with others (PROXIMITY?)

- (6) In what kind of environment do these agents operate?
  - Simplest terms, resources scattered throughout environment. More advanced may have resources that influence other actions, fitness, or potentially barriers that inhibit travel. 

- (7) How do these agents interact with this environment?
  - Consume resources
  - I'm unsure of how complicated I can make social dynamics between the agents yet, but things like pooling resources, teamwork, tribe affiliation all come to mind. 
  - If possible, there may be generations of agents over time

- (8) If you had to ÒdiscretizeÓ the phenomenon into time steps, what events and in what order would occur during any one time step?

  - Each step would be one movement
  - Resources can be consumed in a particular ratio of resource "amount" and agent consumption. A larger resource may be more for one agent, or less for a group. 
  - Proximity of agents affects social dynamics
  - Movement, Seeking resources, affiliation management. Potentially, birth, growth, death. 

- (9) What do you hope to observe from this model?
  - I'm curious how different takes on teamwork affects resource consumption and other-agent/group interactions. What patterns of resource consumption or group size will emerge.
